## Hike with John Summer 2019

I'm seeking companions to join me on four hikes I'd like to complete this year.  Brief descriptions are included below.  As described they are one-way hikes and require a shuttle, but I'm  open to doing them as out-and-back or other alternatives. 

I have traveled 90% of the terrain covered by these hikes so I am familiar with the routes and landscape.  Most of it was completed on day hikes or overnight backpack trips and now I'd like to do them as longer trips.

I've listed the month in which I prefer to do each hike mostly based on typical temperatures in the Sierra at the projected elevation.  But I'm open to adjusting the dates.  Send me an email with your availability and desires: `jdalbey@calpoly.edu`

### May or early June

Yosemite to Clover Meadow

Visit the magnificent redwoods in the newly revamped Mariposa Grove of giant Sequoias and the astonishing granite domes guarding the southern entrance to the Ansel Adams Wilderness.

DURATION 5 days 46.8 miles 

road walking: 15.6 miles
trail hiking: 23.3 miles
easy off-trail hiking: 5.8 miles
difficult cross-country travel: 2 miles

Shuttle drive (one-way):  2 hr

### August

Grant Grove to Onion Valley

Visit the General Grant tree then walk along the divide separating the Kings and Kaweah drainages with amazing vistas. Descend into Kings Canyon and then travel through the fantastic glacier sculpted canyon of Bubbs Creek and cross the Sierra Crest near the spectacular formation of Kearsarge Pinnacles.

DURATION  5-7 days  53 miles 

road walking: 12 miles
trail hiking: 35 miles
easy off-trail hiking: 5 miles
difficult cross-country travel: 1 miles

Shuttle drive (one-way): 5 hr 40 min

### September

Clover Meadow to Wishon

Descend to the mighty San Joaquin River and traverse the remote and seldom visited landscape to its east.  Enjoy a soak in Mono Hot Springs and visit several large reservoirs that generate hydroelectric power.

Ascend from oak hillsides all the way to giant sequoias.  Even though there are a lot of road miles they are largely on abandoned or seldom used roads that are actually quite pretty.

### Terrain Classifications

**Road walking** describes those portions of the route where one is walking on a dirt or paved road.  These include paved and dirt roads that could be accessed by a two-wheel drive vehicle as well as OHV roads.  While most of these are open to vehicle traffic some are closed during winter season and some have been permanently closed to vehicles.  The latter are a special treat for the backpacker since one is afforded the comfort of a well groomed surface without any traffic dangers. 

**Trail walking** is following an existing trail that is well maintained. Established and signed hiking trails in Yosemite National Park are an example.  These are designed for hikers (and sometimes equestrians) and are constructed at an easy gradient and provide switchbacks where the grade would become difficult. 

**Easy off-trail hiking** is found most often where an old trail has been abandoned and no longer maintained.   In many cases the trailbed for these abandoned routes is still obvious and sometimes previous hikers have stacked rock cairns to mark their passage.  The most common obstacles are bushes that have encroached on the trail and downed trees that were never cleared.  This category of travel also includes cross country travel through open terrain, usually a forest that has been logged in the past and is free of undergrowth.  While it may be steeper than trail walking there are no major impediments to travel and one can usually follow a straight line to one's destination.  This kind of open forest hiking can be very enjoyable as it provides the experience of traveling through an undeveloped landscape where plants and animals exist in a natural state.  

**Difficult cross-country travel** presents the most rugged and strenuous type of terrain.  One has attained this degree of difficulty when one's forward progress is inhibited by natural features in the landscape; boulder fields, avalanche downage, manzanita patches, thick forest undergrowth, swamps, granite cliffs and benches, steep and rocky hillsides.  This kind of terrain can be encountered even where the map indicates there should be a trail; some unmaintained trails have decayed to an extent that they have reverted to a primordial, jungle-like state of impenetrability. Some of the worst terrain exists where it passes through forest fire burns where the low lying bushes have decided to return with a vengeance. Overall while there are a few passages that are very steep, and some sections that are loose or slippery, there is nothing that can't be surmounted with caution and a good bit of physical effort.

There is no class 3 travel planned for any of these hikes.
